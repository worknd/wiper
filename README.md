# wiper

This is modified clone of "wiper.sh" - SATA SSD free-space TRIM utility, by Mark Lord <mlord@pobox.com>.
It is part of his project: https://github.com/Distrotech/hdparm.
Script was changed for correct working in WiFi router with "Padavan" firmware.

Also has been written small script "test-discard.sh" for testing of clone work.
